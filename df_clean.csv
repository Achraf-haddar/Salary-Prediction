Machine Learning Engineer,49-88 ,"At Sisu, we're building a software platform that empowers people to make better decisions using data.

Position Overview

The Manager, Chief Engineer will manage a team of CFEs with direction from the Director of Operations. This position will oversee workflow/work order management, training plans, event management, customer communications, hiring and performance management of their assigned CFE team. Our CFEs are respected, well-trained, customer-focused and some of the best facilities engineers you will find in the industry. This position will leverage your extensive experience to help guide the team in some of the more challenging aspects of maintenance in areas such as: critical MOP development, testing plans, sparing approaches, capital planning, end-of-life replacement and expansion of existing facilities while eliminating risk to our customers and their businesses.

While this position is leadership-focused, the intent is to be a Chief Engineer first and a people manager second.
